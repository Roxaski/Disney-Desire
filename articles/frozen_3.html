                    <p>Frozen, one of Disney most prolific movies to have released in the past decade. This movies was in my personal opinion to be one of Disney's best works ever.</p>

                    <p>The first frozen movie is arguably one of Disney's most profitable releases amassing a staggering $1.2 billion dollars at the box office way back in 2013, it was a culteral phenomenon. Everyone and their grandma was enthralled with this film, the songs and everything that went along with it.</p>

                    <p>So it was likely no surprise that Disney's Animation Studios would be working on a sequel to the first film, which captured the hearts of many all around the world, but question is could they really do it again? Would they be able to once again capture the proverbial lightning in a bottle twice. Well the answer is ... YES!</p>

                    <img src="../assets/articles/frozen_ana_elsa.webp" width="1920" height="1080" alt="ana looking up at elsa">

                    <p>Frozen 2 had captivated audiences even more so than the original movie, raking in a whopping $1.4 billion dollars at the box office in 2019, it's pretty clear that Disney are onto an absolute winner with this franchise which is something we haven't really seen from Disney since the likes of their earlier films, which to this day are some one of the most beloved animated films of all time.</p>

                    <p>With an announcement from Disney's CEO Bob Iger, which stated that a variety of films had  now entered into active development across a variety of Disney's various animation studios, including the likes of <a target="_blank" class="red" href="../articles/toy_story_5.html">Toy Story</a> and <a target="_blank" class="red" href="../articles/mando_movie.html">The Mandalorian movie</a>, we have absolutely no doubt that these will also become absolute gigantic commercial and financial blockbuster hits for Disney.</p>

                    <p>While we don't have a release date for the newly announced films, we imagine that these releases are still a fair ways away, we cannot wait to see what's in store for Anna, Elsa and everyone's favourite little cheeky snowman, Olaf.</p>
