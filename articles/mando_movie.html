                        Disney has confimred that The Mandalorian movie is set to release in theatres on the 22nd of May 2026
                    </p>

                    <p>One of most popular recent Star Wars releases in recent history is that of The Mandalorian. The series follows the story of Din Djarin as he travels across the galaxy with the cutest little creature you have ever layed your eyes on, known as Grogu. They set of on a journey in an attempt to evade the Empire who's desperately trying to get their clutches on Grogu for reasons beknownst only to them. What follow is a race across the galaxies, meeting many a foe and allie in their incredible adventure.</p>

                    <p>Disney has been very secretive when it comes to actual plot details for the upcoming movie. But we do know that it will by renown director John Favreau, best known for his work on Disney's Jungle Book and Lion King amongst others. While the film itself is likely to be The Mandalorian's last we can at least expect to see the iconic Storm Troopers, along with the awesome AT-AT's.</p>

                    srcset="../assets/articles/article_mando_small.webp 480w,
                            ../assets/articles/article_mando_medium.webp 800w,
                            ../assets/articles/article_mando_large.webp 1200w,
                            ../assets/articles/article_mando_extra_large.webp 1920w"

                    alt="the mandalorian riding a bike">

                    <p>The series is universally praised by Star Wars fans far and wide, accumulating an impressive amount of viewing time, as of the time of writing the series has amassed more than 1 billion minutes, which is no small feat.</p>

                    <p>While the series has 3 fantastic series under it's very bountiful belt, the next outing for out merry band of outlaws is being turned into a film, this is rumoured to partly be in turn with the recent writers strike of America, which saw over 10 thousand writers go on strike, advocating for a better living wage and to be fairly compensated for their work.</p>

                    <p>The details of the film itself are pretty much under wraps at Lucas Film as you'd imagine, but we can safely assume that we will likely see the return of fan favourite characters like Bo Katan, Boba Fett and likely many more. We personally cannot wait to find out more about this film!</p>
