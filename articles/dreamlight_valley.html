                    <p>Dreamlight Valley is a cozy game, in a similar way to that of Nintendo's Animal Crossing. You have an island that is comprised of a variety of biomes, ranging from a beautiful beach to a creepy swamp, a forest and a snowy mountain area. You'll meet and befriend a wide variety of Disney characters, all of which you can eventually add to your island.</p>

                    <p>The game is being developed by the mobile developer 'Gameloft' who is known for various titles such as the racing games, Asphalt and another racing game which also uses a variety of Disney characters and tracks, and i have to say they've done a fantastic job with this game with a wide variety of ways for you to play and interact with your favourite Disney characters, you can even design your own clothes, customise your home to your hearts desire, do quests for and with all of your friends, go exploring together and so much more.</p>

                    <p>Dreamlight Valley was originally a free to play title, that had launched into early access. Though likely due in part to the game being a massive success, the game was turned into a purchase to play game. With this though came the announcement that Gameloft would be adding a content pass of sorts to the game, which would be comprised of a brand new massive island which is comprised of three diverse biomes, a slew of new characters and activities for you to experience.</p>

                    <p>While this didn't go exactly over too well with some players, as some people expected the game to remain free, while others lamented Gameloft locking certain Disney characters such as the likes of Eve from Wall-e and Oswald the lucky the lucky rabbit, a majority of people seems to be quite excited for this new major content addition.</p>

                    <p>The expansion itself will comprised of various acts, with the first set to release this fall and subsequent chapters releasing in the coming months.</p>

                    <p>Dreamlight Valley is available on all major platforms | PS5, PC, XBOX SERIES S|X, NINTENDO SWITCH.</p>
