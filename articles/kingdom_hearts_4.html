                    <p>After it's initial announcements a little while ago in 2022, at the series 20th anniversary, there's been complete radio silence from the Osaka Team at Square Enix, who are the developers of this incredible franchise.</p>

                    <p>The game series that stars a whole bunch of unique characters from developer Square Enix, along with all of your favourite Disney characters, and a few Square Enix characters from the popular franchise Final Fantasy.</p>

                    <p>Who would of thought that a game that combined characters from a variety of franchises would be this popular? Well, it actually happened by hapstance, as Testusya Nomura bumped into some Disney execs in an office elevator, and taking his chances he pitched the premise of this dearly beloved series, which was the greenlit and given the go ahead. What followed was an immensely passionate fanbase that has grown ever more popular across the 20 years this franchise has been around, here's hoping to many more years with this incredible franchise.</p>

                    <!--  https://youtu.be/j2DSEkYFRh8?t=247  -->

                    <p>The story follows a young boy named Sora, and his friends Kairi, and Riku. They all live together on an island surrounded by nothing but ocean, when one day a giant monster called Darkside happens to appear at their quaint island home, and with him arrive little beings known as the heartless, this sets our trio on their adventure to reunite once more, and the mysteries that unfold therein are many, it's a story you do not want to miss out on this increibly heartfelt and action packed story.</p>

                    <p>It's my personal favourite game series of all time, spanning across a wide variety of games, and across a variety of consoles. Thankfully you can now play almost the entirety of the story on modern consoles and pc, though be aware that some of the games are also on mobile, and even those stories are important to the overarching plot of Kingdom Hearts.</p>

                    <p>If you want to play an action packed game, that will pull at your heartstrings and have you visiting some of Disney's most iconic worls and the characters who reside within, then look no further than <a target="_blank" class="red" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkchJdAevV8">Kingdom Hearts</a>.
                    
                    <p>So when can we expect more news? Alot of people are thinking we might have some more news at this years Tokyo Game Show or Disney's D23, or it could show up at ny other even really. There's so many coming up, usually around the summer and thereafter.</p>

                    <p>While i won't talk about the specifics of the story, to avoid any spoilers! since this is a story very much worth experiencing for yourself, i will leave the trailer for the series <a target="_blank" class="red" href="https://youtu.be/j2DSEkYFRh8">20th anniversary</a> which shows you a look at what's coming soon, including the likes of a new mobile game and the ending of the Dark Road saga, but if you are only wanting to see the trailer for the latest numbered game in the series then you can skip to <span>4:07</span> on the video.</p>

                    <p><span>Kingdom Hearts is available on all major platforms | PS5, PC, XBOX SERIES S|X, NINTENDO SWITCH.</span></p>
