                    <p>Wish, was created to be Disney's big 100th year aniversary celebration movie, but how did it do?</p>

                    <p>Celebrating 100 years is the Walt Disney Company, who would of thought that the incredibly popular and beloved would be around for this long. This really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone though as Disney is one of the world's most popular and well known brands.</p>

                    <p>While Disney did alot of cool stuff to celebrate this incredible milestone, such as putting up beautiful platinum statues around the Disney Parks, and releasing a tonne of new merch, but the thing that most people were really excited for was Disney's movie <a target="_blank" class="red" href="https://youtu.be/oyRxxpD3yNw">Wish</a> along with it's incredible star studded cast and gorgeous visuals, and catchy songs, but it didn't do aswell as was hoped.</p>

                    <p>The movie which had a lot of hype around it, failed to meet the expectations of those at Disney. With a budget of around $200 million, and only having have made $255 million at the office box, it was considered a flop. While Wish was nominated for a few different awards such as best animated feature film, it failed to impress.</p>
                    
                    <p>The whole reception and dissapointment around Wish, was echoed by it's ratings with <a target="_blank" class="red" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11304740/">IMDb</a> giving it a 5.6/10 and <a target="_blank" class="red" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wish_2023">Rotten Tomatoes</a> giving it a 48% critic rotten score while the audience scoring it a 85% rating.</p>

                    <p>The whole debacle caused Disney's CEO Bob Iger, to announce that the company would taking on a new strategy of putting quality first, and focus on that rather than focusing on quantity.</p>

                    <p>Wish is now streaming on Disney Plus.</p>
